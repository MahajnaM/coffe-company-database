# coffe-company-database
The comapny has a large number of employees and sells varied 
products. The company also has contracts with various suppliers, who supply products for sell.
Sells and deliveries of products are registered in an activity table.
I built a sqlite3 database that will hold the employee, supplier, product, coffee_stand
and activity tables.
The database filename will be moncafe.db.
You will have to implement three Python modules: initiate.py, action.py and 
printdb.py.
The data base support persistence layer (DAO, DTO, Repository) !!
